## :dart: About

My project involved creating a website that integrates a form with the Pok√©mon API to fetch dynamic data. I adopted TypeScript for secure typing and enhanced productivity, while Styled Components were used for dynamic and component-oriented styling. For form construction and validation, I integrated React Hook Form with Yup, providing a smooth and intuitive user experience. React Query was employed for asynchronous state management and data caching, ensuring optimized performance and user agility. Additionally, I implemented Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles for an organized and scalable codebase, utilizing Inversify for dependency injection in TypeScript applications. Leveraging Next.js for Server-Side Rendering (SSR) facilitated fast initialization and improved SEO experience. This project served as an opportunity to explore and integrate various cutting-edge technologies, resulting in a dynamic, responsive, and easily maintainable application.
